"""World environment manager.

This module provides the World class, a high-level manager for vectorized Gymnasium
environments with integrated support for data collection, policy evaluation, video
recording, and dataset management. It serves as the central orchestration layer for
training and evaluating world models with domain randomization support.

The World class handles:
    - Vectorized environment creation and management
    - Policy attachment and execution
    - Episode data collection with automatic sharding
    - Video recording from live rollouts or stored datasets
    - Policy evaluation with comprehensive metrics
    - Visual domain randomization through variation spaces

Example:
    Basic usage for policy evaluation::

        from stable_worldmodel import World
        from stable_worldmodel.policy import RandomPolicy

        # Create a world with 4 parallel environments
        world = World(
            env_name="PushT-v1",
            num_envs=4,
            image_shape=(96, 96),
            max_episode_steps=200
        )

        # Attach a policy
        policy = RandomPolicy()
        world.set_policy(policy)

        # Evaluate the policy
        metrics = world.evaluate(episodes=100, seed=42)
        print(f"Success rate: {metrics['success_rate']:.2f}%")

    Data collection example::

        # Collect demonstration data
        world.record_dataset(
            dataset_name="pusht_demos",
            episodes=1000,
            seed=42,
            options={'variation': ['all']}
        )

Todo:
    * Add real-time metric visualization during evaluation

    """High-level manager for vectorized Gymnasium environments with integrated data collection.

    World orchestrates multiple parallel environments, providing a unified interface for
    policy execution, data collection, evaluation, and visualization. It automatically
    handles environment resets, batched action execution, and comprehensive episode
    tracking with support for visual domain randomization.

    The World class is the central component of the stable-worldmodel library, designed
    to streamline the workflow from data collection to policy training and evaluation.
    It wraps Gymnasium's vectorized environments with additional functionality for
    world model research.

    Attributes:

            and VariationWrapper for image processing and domain randomization.

        policy (Policy): Currently attached policy that generates actions.
        states (ndarray): Current observation states for all environments.
        rewards (ndarray): Current rewards for all environments.
        terminateds (ndarray): Terminal flags indicating episode completion.
        truncateds (ndarray): Truncation flags indicating episode timeout.
        infos (dict): Dictionary containing major information from environments.

    Properties:
        num_envs (int): Number of parallel environments.
        observation_space (Space): Batched observation space.

        single_action_space (Space): Action space for a single environment.
        single_observation_space (Space): Observation space for a single environment.

    Note:
        Environments use DISABLED autoreset mode to enable custom reset behavior
        with seed and options support, which is not provided by Gymnasium's default
        autoreset mechanism.

            verbose (int, optional): Verbosity level. 0 for silent, 1 for basic info,
                2+ for detailed debugging information. Defaults to 1.

        Args:
            episodes (int, optional): Total number of episodes to evaluate. More
                episodes provide more statistically reliable metrics. Defaults to 10.
